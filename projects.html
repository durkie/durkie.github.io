Concrete Jungle is a volunteer-run non-profit organization based out of Atlanta. We pick fruit that grows on fruit trees all over the city and donate it to local homeless shelters and food banks. We also have a 1 acre farm where we grow food exclusively for donation. Currently at ~15,000 lbs (of apples, serviceberries, pears, quince, pomegranates, persimmons, muscadines, mulberries, peaches, figs, carrots, onions, kale, cabbage, tomatoes, cucumbers and sweet potatoes) donated.

<p>Chipero connects tree services with people and organizations that want wood chips for their yard/farm/garden/park. Almost all tree services make wood chips, and almost all of them have a disorganized list of wood chip recipients that sits on an office computer as a big Word document. Chipero uses your location to show you who is closest that needs wood chips. No more lists, no more office hassle to find a dump site.</p>
<p>Plus, since Chipero works with many tree services, people sign up for wood chip dump sites preferentially though Chipero. Sign up once, get seen by the tree service that's actually likely to be working near you.</p>

        <h2>Yawl Bikes</h2><h4>Founder (very generous title)</h4>

Yawl Bikes's goal was to manufacture tungsten carbide-coated bicycle rims for biketrials riders. The coating provided a low-wearing abrasive surface to meet the unusual (instant lock and tremendous hold) braking needs of trials riders. This product was heavily inspired a similar offering from Plazmatic around the late nineties, but that product required riders to mail in their rims for coating, whereas Yawl was simply going to sell pre-coated new rims (for cheaper, since they could be produced in volume.)
          </p>
          <p>
Ultimately, it was too hard to produce. The coating texture had to be just right and the texture was heavily dependent on coating process parameters (basically locking you in to a the spray setup of specific coating shop) and small changes in feedstock powder composition and particle size distribution would produce textures that did not work.
</p>
<p>Additionally, promising coatings would have quite variable wear wear rates. A particular WC-Co-Cr -30/+5 powder would test marvelously in coupon form, only to "bed-in" after a half hour of real use and then perform poorly. A separate but slightly different WC-Co-Cr -30/+5 powder would work excellently for months.
</p>
<p> So, we had repeatable results, but only with <strong>this</strong> exact powder sprayed from <strong>this</strong> exact process (HVAF, an air-fed variant of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HVOF">HVOF</a>, which is only done by two companies that hate each other). When I ultimately had a falling out about a price agreement with my shop, the thought of starting coating development over with a different coating manufacturer was not exciting. Having multiple degrees in materials science, I do consider it a failure that I couldn't produce a limited-scope niche product like this.
