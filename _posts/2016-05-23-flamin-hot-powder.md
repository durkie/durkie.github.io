A dear friend of ours is completely addicted to Flamin Hot Cheetos, and in like a gross way where he just sucks all the powder off the Cheeto and throws it away and his fingers are always pink. That's no way to live.

So me and Andy came up with homemade Flamin Hot Cheetos Dust. How did we do it? We bought all the ingredients off the back of the Cheetos bag and used it to come up with relative proportions of each. There's a few things we skipped (like whey, whey protein concentrate, colors, buttermilk and "natural flavor"), but all the rest is there. [Go make your own!](https://www.instructables.com/id/Flamin-Hot-Cheeto-Powder/) And pair it with something oily (like french fries). That's where it really shines.
