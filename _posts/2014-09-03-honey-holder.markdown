I love collecting honey from different parts of the world. Ever since I started beekeeping, I've noticed how different the honey would taste between hives that were only a few miles apart. Whenever a friend is travelling abroad I always ask them to bring me back local honey. 

I thought then that it would be a nice gift for my friends' wedding to give them a sampler of some of the interesting honeys that I've collected from all around the world:

It's 3d-printed PLA with black oil paint highlighting. It took about 12 hours to print on our MendelMax 2.0. The jars came from [Specialty Bottle](http://www.specialtybottle.com/).

The Ethiopian is the most exotic â€” it was obtained at a market outside a refugee camp on the Ethiopia/Somalia border. It came in a big plastic bottle, the top quarter of which was solid, smoky wax. 

If you decide to print one of your own don't bother with support material. It will will require only minor cleanup afterwards in comparison with removing support material from a lot of the overhangs. You may also want to remove the bottom border from the model so that it can simply sit upright.
