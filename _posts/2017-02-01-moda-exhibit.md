The [Museum of Design Atlanta](//www.museumofdesign.org) has an exhibit on the future of food, and Concrete Jungle's prototype tree sensors are featured as part of the Food Revolutionaries section. Not bad!

And if you get there at 12:11pm on a Wednesday you can get your photo taken by the automatic fruit tree camera.
