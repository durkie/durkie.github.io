[Andy](http://www.andrewquitmeyer.com) has long wanted barefoot pedals for some reason. I love biking from fruit tree to swimming hole every day I'm able to, but rarely during those days do I feel bummed out about wearing shoes while biking.

Nonetheless, Andy had a birthday coming up and I had to get him something. So, [barefoot pedals]({{ site.url }}/barefootpedals.tar.gz) (sketchup files). Some of the pedal dimensions are weird — they're meant to support the whole width of the foot, and in Andy's case that's a size 15 foot.

Starting point — rip off the cage, keep the bolts and spacers.

3d-printed on a Stratasys machine out of ABS. This one also features the most comfortable and secure big-toe post, the conical shaped one on the left side of the image.

These lasted Andy about a week and a half before they started breaking. So, things to do for the next go-round:

* More durable material (possibly just wood, but 3d printed was so easy for a quick birthday present)
* Better big toe post — use the comfy cone-shaped post everywhere, and move it about 1/4" / 6mm further forward of the pedal axle.
* Possibly only put toe posts on one side of the pedal.
